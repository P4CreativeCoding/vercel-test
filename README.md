Based on the Vercel CLI documentation, here's a step-by-step guide on how to deploy an Express app to Vercel that responds with "test" when an endpoint is triggered:

1. **Install Vercel CLI**: If you haven't installed the Vercel CLI, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. **Create an Express App**: Create a new directory for your Express app and navigate into it. Then, initialize a new Node.js project and install Express:

```bash
mkdir my-express-app && cd my-express-app
npm init -y
npm install express
```

3. **Write Your Express App**: Create a new file named `index.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('test');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This code creates a simple Express app that listens on the root ("/") path and responds with "test".

4. **Prepare for Vercel**: Vercel expects a `vercel.json` file for configuration. Create this file in the root of your project and add the following:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.js", "use": "@vercel/node" }]
}
```

This tells Vercel to use the `@vercel/node` builder for your `index.js` file.

5. **Deploy to Vercel**: Now you can deploy your app to Vercel. Run the following command:

```bash
vercel
```

Follow the prompts in the CLI to deploy your app. Once deployed, Vercel will give you a URL where your app is live.

Remember, Vercel CLI requires you to log in and authenticate before accessing user-specific content or performing administrative tasks. You can use `vercel login` for this purpose. In a CI/CD environment where manual input is not possible, you can create a token on your tokens page and then use the `--token` option to authenticate.
